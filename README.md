# Flutter Method Channel

In this repo you can find a example of `flutter method channel`.
Here I create a `Toast Message` example using `Android Native` Code. which is in `Kotlin`.
I also provided the `Java native` code into `MainActivity` file.


## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.


## Android Method Channel Implement
1. Call invoke method for connecting with method channel
2. Set the necessary functions ans keys
3. If you are in VS Code, press `right` button of your `mouse` and open the `android` folder into `Android Studio`
4. Now follow this path for finding `MainActivity` file
   1. `android -> kotlin+java / java -> com.example.your_app_name -> MainActivity.kt / MainActivity.java`
5. If your project created with `kotlin` then use the `kotlin` code or your project created on `java` then use `java` code
